Well, i wanted to go to Troms, i'm a lvl 35 Archer, so i get some speed and go. i made it to the gate, cross the bridge, and die and BLOCK off of Troms, my guy glitched, and instead of spawning into Elkurn, i spawn UNDER THE BRIDGE, AND ON A STONE STRIP SURROUNDED BY LAVA-SWIMMING MAGMA CUBES! i dont know how it happened, but please just get  a mod to teleport me out or something. i am on server 38. PLEASE HURRY! if i die one more time, i loose everything.
